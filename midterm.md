* Team Members Names and Contributions:
- Tej Vyas - worked on the login and registration pages as well as database, incorrect_password_check and config files. Pushed everything to the github repo.
- Yash Hirpara - Currently working on setting up the db with mysql working with Hiten, trying to connect our login and registration page to the db. Created the db, created the frist user who will have access to the whole table. Now were in the process of creating the config file, ids and attirbutes in mysql. Also updated the port setting on asw for the vm to access other vms. We are still in beta phase for this project. The group has been up to date with the requested requirements but are slighly behind with some specific deliverey components.
- Hiten Patel - worked on SQL & DB. 1st we download the SQL & update it! We create the table & show the table. After we try to connect DB to the login & registration page. Currently, we're having an issue connecting DB.
- Parth Brahmbhatt - worked on the html file for our login and registration page. Where a new users can register by providing there email address, username, password, and confirm password. I have also worked on the css file for the registration page in order to make it look more organized and make it easier for the users to navigate.
- Amisha Patel - worked on implementing Rsyslog on our server which we used as a centralization login solution. We install the rsyslog and made rsyslog file accessible for UDP and TCP ports 514. We created template that will instruct rsyslog to store incoming messages. Since we were using the private IP address instead of Public IP address we had issues connecting the server side. We made successful connection with the client using the Public IP address.
- Naiya Patel - worked on creating, managing, and updating issues on project board. Created a separate project board for Login and Registration. Debugged the codes and scripts.
